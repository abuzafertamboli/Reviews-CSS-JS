# Reviews
Hi, this repository contains a Reviews Preview web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app displays reviews from different people, allowing users to navigate through them using arrow buttons. Additionally, a "Surprise Me" button has been added to randomly showcase a review. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and randomization in JavaScript.
